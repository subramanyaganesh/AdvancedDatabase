The implementation for the B+ Tree is complete and implementation present in the file btree_mgr.c.
The additional test were done to check memory leakage.
“Makefile” contains all the necessary instruction to compile and run the application.

====================================================================================
B+ Tree
====================================================================================

The Tree are implemented as follows:
	For each Node there will be a page file.
	Header information is in the Page 0. The header contains the following information
		keyType - Key type
	 	size 		- Size of B+ tree (the n)
	 	numEntries
	 	numNodes
	  depth
	  whereIsRoot - The page where Root is located
	  nextPage

		The starting point is fetching the whereIsRoot and building the tree from there.
		The tree is stored in the file systems and we can retrieve the data of B tree
		even after we complete the run.

CONFIGURE Memory Leaks Check
====================================================================================
1. Open X-code -> new project -> commandLine

2. Add the files to the X-code by right click on project and select “Add files to ..”
		(Note: Add one test file at a time as X-Code does not support multiple mains)

3. Place a debug point at starting point and last point

4. Open instruments

5. Run the test files and note the processed displayed in the left panel. The program should stop at the first debug point.

6. Go to Instruments and click on record. Select the process with the process id we noted in previous step.

7. Now click resume.

8. Check for any leaks in the program.

====================================================================================
Make DIR and Run
====================================================================================
1. Create a new directory to store files.

2. To run it, execute the following commands
        $ make
        $./bin/test_assign/run
        $./bin/test_expr/run
